          <p className="font-light text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-white/80">
            In a quiet corner of a city humming with noise and ambition, a dream was stitched ‚Äî not with
            threads, but with vision, fire, and fearless intent. VENUSA was born not in a glossy studio,
            but across college benches and late-night conversations between friends who saw fashion differently.
          </p>
          <p className="font-light text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-white/80">
            The founder, brimming with purpose, wanted a brand where confidence wasn‚Äôt worn ‚Äî it was owned.
            Alongside her stood the co-founder, a mind wired for momentum, turning scraps into samples and
            obstacles into opportunities. Together they weren‚Äôt just building a brand; they were building a culture.
